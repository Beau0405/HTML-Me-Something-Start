            <h4>People: My Wife, My Family, My dog</h4>
            <p>I grew up in St. Louis and I love this city. I was born in Dogtown, and went to St. James the Greater until 4th grade. After that my mom and step-dad moved to Jefferson County, where i went to school at Windsor. My dad lived in South County in Bayless/Affton area. 
               I went to Windsor until freshman year, then I decided to go to Bayless High School. That did not work out, so I went back to Windsor until junior year. I started junior year at South County Tech.
               I graduated from South Tech in 1999.</p>

            <h3 id="underline">Clarksville, Tennessee</h3>
            <h5>Moved to Clarksville after a few years out of high school. Mom had moved down a few years prior, and had other family there.</h5>
            <h3 id="underline">Manhatten, New York</h3>
            <h5>Moved to New York after my wife was offered a job at New York Presbyterian (I was also a painter for them)</h5>
            <h3 id="underline">Jacksonville, Florida</h3>
            <h5>Still haven't figured out this move. It was nice living by the beach. But come on it is Florida.</h5> 
            <p>Being from a divorced family, I guess I have always been trying to figure out where I belong in all of it.All I know is no matter where I might end up. I will always belong in St. Louis</p>

         <p>I am hoping to complete my Launchcode class, and get a job in the tech industry. All I know is I hope my future does not involve me having to work in 
            the construction/manual labor field anymore. I am hoping on landing a remote job eventually, and buy an RV and travel around the world.</p>
